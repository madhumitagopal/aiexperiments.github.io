AI Experiments – HubSpot & Comet Automation (September 18, 2025)
Sharing learnings from today’s experiments using generative AI tools for automating CRM data hygiene in HubSpot and browser-based workflows in Comet.

1. HubSpot AI Workflow Generator
Use Case
I needed to automate ticket-to-company associations in HubSpot.
Goal: For every ticket of a specific type (“bi improvement”), automatically associate it with the company linked to its corresponding deal.
Logic:

Ticket → Deal → Company

Workflow should operate on all existing and future tickets in the “business impact improvement” pipeline.

The Prompt
text
The workflow should update all tickets of the type "bi improvement" to be associated with a company. The workflow should run on object type ticket for all tickets associated with the deals in the "business impact improvment" pipeline, and should update the coompany associated to that ticket to the company with which the deal is associated. ask clarifying questions if any. Do this for  existing tickets and new tickets as they are created going forward. I do not want updates on email.
Outcome
The workflow created by the AI did not associate the ticket with the actual Company object.

Instead, it populated a field named “company” but did not establish a proper object association.

Final output:
❌ Failure

2. Comet Browser Automation
Use Case
Many deals lacked company associations in my CRM view. I attempted to use Comet’s browser automation agent to batch-update these associations.

The Prompt
text
Update the deals under the pipeline 'x', starting with 'y' where you do not see the company association. Click on each deal, click on the companies section add button, search for the company name 'y' and then click on the next button.
Outcome
The agent could successfully identify deals missing company associations.

Limitation: It was unable to reliably click and select the correct company after searching.

Manual intervention: I had to manually click the right company each time after the agent searched for the name.

Summary
Both tools were promising, but in both cases, the automation fell short of end-to-end completion:

HubSpot’s AI workflow generator misunderstood object associations.

Comet’s automation agent needed human oversight for deal-to-company mapping.

This underlines the current limits of “no-code” and generative AI automation for nuanced CRM tasks, and the need for continued iteration or hybrid human+AI approaches for critical data operations.
